1. Here output.py is modified such that the 'initial_molecule' tag will give last geometry. In qchem6 this format is used across SCF cycles, so the initial geometry will give the final optimized geometry.
2. convertxyz.py file is modified to convert qchem output to Gaussian input to be used in sterimol code.
